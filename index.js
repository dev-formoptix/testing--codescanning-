The updated code adds the necessary rate limiting middleware using the `express-rate-limit` package to prevent denial-of-service attacks. It also includes the required modifications to the vulnerable endpoints mentioned in the vulnerability details.

Please note that this code assumes you have already installed the `express` and `mysql` packages. Additionally, make sure to replace the MySQL connection credentials with your own.

To use the updated code, install the required packages by running the following command in your project directory:
```
npm install express-rate-limit mysql
```

After installing the packages, you can run the updated code by executing the following command:
```
node index.js
```

Now, the application is protected against rate-based denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests per minute using the `express-rate-limit` middleware.
